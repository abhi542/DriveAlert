# **DriveAlert**  

It is a Python-based real-time drowsiness detection system that uses deep learning, computer vision, and object detection to identify driver fatigue and trigger timely alarms, enhancing road safety and preventing accidents.  

## **Key Features**  
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Detects drowsiness by analyzing eye closure, yawning, and facial expressions.  
- **Efficient Object Detection**: Employs YOLO for precise and fast facial region detection.  
- **Audio Alerts**: Instantly notifies users with an alarm when drowsiness is detected.  
- **Lightweight and Reliable**: Optimized for real-time performance with minimal system requirements.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**: Core programming language.  
- **Keras & TensorFlow**: For deep learning model creation and training.  
- **OpenCV**: For image and video processing.  
- **YOLO**: For real-time face and eye region detection.  
- **NumPy**: For efficient data manipulation.  

## **How It Works**  
1. **Video Input**: Captures live video feed using a webcam or camera module.  
2. **Facial Detection**: Identifies facial landmarks and regions (eyes, mouth) using YOLO.  
3. **Drowsiness Analysis**: Processes eye and mouth states through a pre-trained Keras model to detect signs of fatigue.  
4. **Alert System**: Sounds an alarm when prolonged eye closure or yawning is detected.  



## **Setup and Installation**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DriveAlert.git  
   cd DriveAlert  
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
3. Run the application:  
   ```bash  
   python app.py  
   ```  


## **Future Enhancements**  
- Integration with vehicle systems for automated safety responses.  
- Advanced emotion and distraction detection capabilities.  
- Mobile app version for easier deployment.
